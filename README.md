This program essentially runs an abridged two player game of no-limit texas hold-em. I say "abridged" because instead of having four betting rounds (pre-flop, flop, turn, river), it is all condensed into one --- post-river). This decision was made for the sake of making rounds faster (less reading). The program also calculates each player's chances of winning any given round by calculating many possible other permutations and comparing this with the player's hand (considering one standard 52-card deck). As you might expect, the program can also determine the winner of a hand based on the cards dealt by first determining the hand (high card, pair, two pair, etc.) and then evaluating the "better hand" between the two and, in the case of a tie, evaluating the higher pair or kicker as needed. I hope to make a GUI in the future (or someone else can try and share!). Anyways, gamble responsibly.
